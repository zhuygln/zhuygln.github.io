Applying automated machine learning techniques to streamline model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering for scientific data analysis. AutoML pipelines enable rapid prototyping and benchmarking of predictive models across diverse datasets, reducing the manual overhead typically associated with building machine learning solutions for research applications.

This work explores how modern AutoML frameworks can be leveraged in scientific computing contexts, where data characteristics differ significantly from typical industry datasets — often featuring high-dimensional physical observables, complex correlations, and limited sample sizes.
