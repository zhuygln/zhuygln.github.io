We examined different combinations of nuclear inputs of nuclear mass, spontaneous fission rate, and fission yields in modeling kilonova light curves. Such nuclear physics uncertainties typically generate at least one order of magnitude uncertainty in key quantities such as the nuclear heating (one and a half orders of magnitude at one day post-merger), the bolometric luminosity (one order of magnitude at five days post-merger), and the inferred mass of material from the bolometric luminosity (factor of eight when considering the eight to ten days region).

This work highlights how sensitive kilonova observables are to nuclear physics inputs that remain poorly constrained, underscoring the need for improved experimental measurements of neutron-rich nuclei far from stability. Our modeling incorporates multiple fission fragment distribution models and mass models to bracket the theoretical uncertainties systematically.
