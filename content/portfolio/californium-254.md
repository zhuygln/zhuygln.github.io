The collaboration led by FIRE (Fission in R-process Elements) members from LANL/NC State/Notre Dame has explored several issues concerning the nuclear physics of Cf-254 production in neutron star merger observations for the first time. We model r-process nucleosynthesis using PRISM (Version 2.0, by LANL/Notre Dame) with all relevant nuclear reaction channels and reheating of the ejecta handled self-consistently.

Due to the anomalously long half-life of this isotope and the efficiency of fission thermalization compared to other nuclear channels, we identified a single isotope, Cf-254, which has a particularly high impact on the brightness of electromagnetic transients associated with mergers on the order of 15 to 250 days.

This identification has important implications for understanding the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events and constraining the nuclear equation of state through multi-messenger observations.
