Neutrinos are a necessary component of the physics of several phenomena associated with neutron star merger remnants, examples include nucleosynthesis and jet production in gamma-ray bursts. Many essential neutrino interactions are dependent on neutrino flavor so that an understanding of the flavor content of the neutrinos is critical for providing an accurate picture of merger phenomena.

Once neutrinos are emitted from hot, dense astrophysical objects, they can change their flavor through neutrino oscillations. In the last few years, it has become apparent that many interesting oscillation effects occur in environments with large numbers of neutrinos.

We confirmed that Matter-Neutrino Resonance (MNR) transitions occur for both hierarchies close to the merger core, which may potentially change the physics of nucleosynthesis and neutron star merger dynamics. This finding has significant implications for understanding the conditions under which heavy elements are produced in these extreme environments.
